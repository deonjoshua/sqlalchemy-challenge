Part 1: Analyse and Explore the Climate Data

In this section, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the provided climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
I performed a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis both of which are contained in the climate.ipynb file

Part 2: Design a Climate App

After completing the initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed.
